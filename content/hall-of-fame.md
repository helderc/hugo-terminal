My malware "Hall of Fame". 

This list is not about the most complex malwares, its about the malwares that somehow I had contact with in the past.
I plan to reverse engineer them and share the writeups. Yes, this is a hell of project! :)

The *hash code*, when provided, corresponds to the sample that I have in my collection.

## Trojan Horse
- [NetBus](...)
- WinCrash
- BackOrifice

## Virus
- Dolly the Sheep
- Vienna (variants will be added later)

## Virus Creation Lab
- NRLG
